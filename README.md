# ðŸš²Toman Bike Shop: Price Analysis and AssessmentðŸš²


Welcome to my newest project! My goal was to assess the money made by a fictional company across two years and then evaluate when they make their most money, along with what they should be increasing their price to in the coming year.

# Goal

Analyze and visualize the company's growth and revenue over the two-year period, then recommend an appropriate price increase strategy.

# Data

**bike_share_yr_0:** contains the data from 2021.

**bike_share_yr_1:** contains the data from 2022.

**cost_table:** contains the prices of the service in both years.

# Tools and Technologies
